Uses stow

## Requirements:

These are the package names for arch/AUR, but I'm sure you can find it
elsewhere

 - awesome
 - git clone https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom-ibhagwan-git
 - termite
 - ttf-hack
 - neovim
 - pamixer

## Instalation
Use `stow [thing]` to have stow set up the configs for that. If you install the fonts, don't forget- to rebuild the font cache (`fc-cache`)
